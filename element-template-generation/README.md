# Element Template Generation

>This example can be extended to demonstrate other element template generations

## Generating Dropdowns with Conditional Properties

This example contains the `CarConnectorInput` that allows to configure a car.

Based on the selected _make_, there are different other dropdowns shown for the _model_. Also, the _gearbox_ is a simple selection.

## Using the template

Please upload the template to the Web Modeler and release it in your project to use it.

As alternative, follow [this guide](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/next/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/element-templates/configuring-templates/) to install it to the Desktop Modeler to use it from there.

## Running the connector

As the connector comes without any dependency, it can be added to any connector runtime as described [here](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/next/components/connectors/custom-built-connectors/connector-sdk/#runtime-environments).
